# 🎶 Content-Based Music Recommendation System  

This project is a **Content-Based Music Recommendation System** that recommends songs based on their audio features such as tempo, rhythm, pitch, and other similarity measures. It uses **Python, feature extraction (Librosa), and machine learning techniques** to provide personalized music suggestions without relying on user history.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Extracts audio features from songs (MFCC, chroma, spectral contrast, etc.)  
- Computes similarity between tracks using cosine similarity / distance metrics  
- Provides top-N music recommendations for a given input song  
- Works without user preference history (purely content-based)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Librosa** (Audio feature extraction)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data handling)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Similarity & ML utilities)
